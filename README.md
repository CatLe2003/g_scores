## Features

*** Data Import & Storage**

  * Raw CSV data (`diem_thi_thpt_2024.csv`) is parsed and stored into a PostgreSQL database.
  * Implemented using a combination of **Rails migrations** and **seeds** (`db/seeds.rb`).

*** Search Student by Registration Number**

  * Users can input a registration number to check a studentâ€™s detailed subject scores.
  * Graceful handling of invalid or missing student records.

*** Score Level Report by Subject**

  * Report divides student scores into 4 levels:

    * **Above 8**
    * **6 to 7.99**
    * **4 to 5.99**
    * **Below 4**
  * The number of students per level per subject is displayed via charts using **Chartkick** + **Groupdate**.

*** Top 10 Students (Group A: Math, Physics, Chemistry)**

  * Displays top 10 students ranked by total score in Group A subjects.
  * Handled directly through ActiveRecord SQL aggregation.

***Responsive UI**: Built with TailwindCSS. Compatible with desktop, tablet, and mobile.
***Frontend Styling**: Clean interface styled using Tailwind and partials in ERB views.
